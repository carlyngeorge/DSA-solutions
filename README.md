# DSA-solutions

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions implemented in C.
The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills, understand core DSA concepts, and build a strong foundation for technical interviews by practicing various problems.

All problems are implemented with clear logic, proper file naming, and easy-to-understand code structure.
